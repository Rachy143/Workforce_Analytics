# Workforce_Analytics
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of workforce data through three interactive dashboards designed in Looker Studio. The goal is to give HR teams and business leaders clear, data-driven insights into employee demographics, compensation structures, and attrition trends.

Workforce Demographics Dashboard explores the distribution of employees by gender, country, city, and other demographic factors, helping to identify diversity and geographic representation.

Compensation Analytics Dashboard highlights salary and bonus trends across job titles and departments, supporting fair pay assessments and strategic compensation planning.

Attrition & Retention Dashboard examines employee turnover patterns, average tenure, and attrition rates, enabling organizations to track retention challenges and improve workforce stability.
